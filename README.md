## About

This is my attempt at a Firefox price-tracking extension for TEMU. It saves the prices of products as you browse the site, storing them locally and displaying them in a popup.

It is still in its infancy, and is buggy. Please feel free to contribute or publish issues. It may not work in all countries or on all products/pages.
